## Briefs for each stage

### ðŸ”´ Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### ðŸŸ¡ Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### ðŸŸ¢ Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### ðŸ”µ Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### ðŸŸ£ Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

**stage one:**
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle.

in regards to the unconventional representation of time i wanted to explore the lifecycle of a star from birth to death.

the cycle goes as follows:
1. a nebulas - which is a cloud of gases and dust that is being condensed by gravity
2. main sequence star - otherwise known as supermassive  and has a stable core - it then expands and gets hotter - 90% of its life time
3. a red supergiant is then formed which has an unstable core and when that core implodes, collapses and bursts into a
4. supernova - freeing all elements created in its lifetime
5. whatâ€™s left of the star is a stellar black hole that has an intense gravitational pull

In what sense is a starâ€™s lifecycle an â€˜unconventionalâ€™ representation of time?
The life cycle of a star is an unconventional representation of time because it takes millions, if not billions of years for a star to completely die off. A time frame completely unfathomable to the human mind. The scale is completely out of proportion to our human history, and some stars have lived much longer than humanity.

Second, processes within a star, such as nuclear fusion in its core, occur at incredibly high temperatures and pressures. This leads to rapid changes and transformations over much shorter periods of time compared to the overall lifespan of the star. This rapid change in the core reminds me of a computing and coding environment. The complex interactions in the star's core that create emergent behaviors and phenomena can then be compared to the performance of machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. Just as stars evolve and exhibit different stages of their life cycle, artificial intelligence systems learn from data and experience to adapt and improve
